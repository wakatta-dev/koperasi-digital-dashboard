# `components/shared` Policy

Use this folder for reusable non-shadcn components shared across modules.

Examples:
- Alert wrappers, toast helpers, confirm dialogs
- Form composites, date/time pickers, async selectors
- Providers and reusable layout shells

Suggested grouping:
- `shared/forms/*` for reusable form composites
- `shared/inputs/*` for reusable input primitives/composites
- `shared/providers/*` for app-level providers
